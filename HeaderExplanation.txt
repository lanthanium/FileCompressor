The header file is the int amount of leaves (for uncompress.cpp to
parse and then iterate through and stop at the end of the header) 
followed by all non-zero leaf nodes represented by their symbol and 
count. For each leaf node, it will take a total space of 
symbol(1 byte) + count (4 byte) = 5 bytes.

BEST CASE SCENARIO: 
In the extreme case of only one particular char (say the letter 't')
appearing 10 million times, the header would look like in bit form
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
01110100
00000000 10011000 10010110 10000000 

The above is explained as follows:
Number of leaves (int i = 1)
116, the letter t, in 8 bit form
10,000,000, the frequency of letter t, in int form (4 bytes/32 bit)

The header file thus would only be 9 total bytes, much better than
1024 bytes.

WORST CASE SCENARIO: 
However, in the other extreme case where every single ASCII symbol
appears at least once, than for each symbol, an integer value has to 
represent their count.  This means that the header size would be
4 bytes (leafNodes total) + [256*(1 byte + 4 bytes)] = 1284 bytes.
In this extreme case, this would not beat the naive solution
of 1024 bytes.
